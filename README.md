# website-login
Basic script that allows you to login to websites using Selenium. Currently supports facebook only.

How to run:
1. Install selenium and python 3
2. Run the inputs.py script. This will produce a pkl file with all your login info (be careful with this!)
3. Run the start.py script. You are now logged in!
